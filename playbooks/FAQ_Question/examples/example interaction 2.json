Payments received after 5 p.m. (CST) may be credited as of the next business day. You may at any time pay, in whole or in part, the total unpaid balance without any additional charge for prepayment. If you have a balance subject to interest, earlier payments may reduce the amount of interest you will pay. We may delay making credit available on your Account in the amount of your payment even though we will credit your payment when we receive it. Account Billing Statements and Notices If you have a credit or debit balance on the Account of $1 or more at the end of any billing cycle, we will send a periodic statement (a “bill”) showing what you owe at the end of that billing cycle. Each statement that we send will identify the billing cycle that it covers.",

You may make payments under this Contract using a check, credit card, debit card, or by ACH transfer (auto-pay). Payments made online and by mailing a physical check are not subject to a customer service fee.
